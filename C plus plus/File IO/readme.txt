For this project, there exists three different types of file io that one can use
The main purpose was to simply test out memory mapped file io
I figured since I was going to code out mm io i might as well do the others

This program directly reads and overwrites your input file

To use:
Step 1: ./a.out <filename>

      Example: If the file whose contents you want to change is default.txt run
             ./a.out default.txt

Step 2: Enter which file io method you want to use. 
        Valid integers are 1, 2, 3
