I came across Errichto lecture on Dynamic programming on Youtube. 
This prompted me to code a very simplified version of dynamic programming.

I wrote two methods to compute the 40th term of the Fibonacci Sequence.
One method uses recursion while the other method used vectors to prevent double counting. 

I then timed both methods and the image is my results. 

The reason I chose to do the 40th term was due to the recursion method.
If I chose I a higher term such as the 50th term, I run out of memory.
If I do 49th term, it takes too long to execute. 

I am very sure that there is a way to streamline this process so please give me suggestions.
